<h1>ICOFace</h1>
<h2>What do we do?</h2>
There can be no secrets if you want to be an ICO person. Investors must now where they put their money. That is why we are making a public database of everybody associated with an ICO, stored securely on the BlockChain.

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
While most of the team is part of Dolphin BI project, we've met new people on the hackathon with whom we had pleasure working. We at Dolphin BI believe that ICO is the future of investment and we want to create an honest and transparent ICO market.

<h2>Innovation</h2>
We use a smart-contract on Qtum blockchain for secure and immutable storage and intellegent image recognition and text analysis algorithms to allow you to quickly find the information you need.

<h2>Technology</h2>
We used Qtum Platform for data storage; nltk, phonetic matching and regex for text analysis, neural network based face recognition; node.js, express.js and MySQL for backend; vue.js and uikit for frontend.

<h2>The biggest obstacle</h2>
The biggest difficulty was to integrate the pieces together and automate saving data on the Qtum blockchain.
